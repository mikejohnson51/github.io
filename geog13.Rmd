In the summer of 2021 I took a GIS course called Introduction to Programming for GIS. This course introduced me to basic concepts for analyzing geospatial data using R. Below are a series of links for all the projects I completed in the course.

## [Building a project website](index.html)

- In this assignment I built a static users site with GitHub Pages.
- I learned how to navigate RStudio and use some basic functions to build a website.
- I was able to resolve error messages on my own to design a website to my preference but hope to continue improving my skills.
